# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Accurately measure and visualize all 10 CooperBench failure modes from multi-agent transcripts
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Failure Mode Evaluation Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 1 (Failure Mode Evaluation Pipeline)
Plan: 2 of TBD in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-13 -- Plan 02 completed (metrics computation + visualization)

Progress: [####░░░░░░] ~40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 55s
- Total execution time: ~2 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 110s | 55s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (57s), 01-02 (53s)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Single-phase delivery: all 13 requirements tightly coupled, no natural split
- Jaccard token overlap for repetition similarity (simple, no external deps)
- Regex-based extraction for file paths and function names in overlap detection
- Technology conflict pairs as explicit set pairs for divergent architecture detection
- Matplotlib Agg backend for headless environments
- Blue gradient color palette for bar chart visualization
- 300 DPI output for publication-quality figures

### Pending Todos
